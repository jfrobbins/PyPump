# PyPump
This library has been written for python 3000 (python 3.x). This will allow you to interface with the pump.io platform (to see a functioning node please see http://pump.io/tryit). The library in it's state today is still very untested and incomplete and since pump.io is also still in an alpha phase no doubt that will change too (inturn we would change).

Updates will be coming soon.

## Requirements
My pyoauth3000 repo (drop it into the PyPump folder for now)
Python3000 (testing on python 3.3)
